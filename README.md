# CodeIgniter
# In Process
This post is for an update about a project on CodeIgniter development. The Home, Shop, and Blog pages are currently functional. My immediate focus is on completing the Post and Product pages. Placeholder images are temporarily used across all three title pages; these will be replaced once the database configuration in phpMyAdmin is finalized.
